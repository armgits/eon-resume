    \item Teaching Assistant for Robotics Laboratory Course - ENEE467
    \item Guiding students to write a roscpp node that commands a UR3e arm to track a square trajectory. 
    \item Guided students in writing a line follower program for the TI Robotics System Learning Kit.
    \item Assisted students with setting up GPIOs, SysTick timer and PWM signal generation on TI-MSP432 Launchpad board.
    \item Supported students in debugging Embedded C code by identifying register value errors and program flow issues.

    \item Developing software for the rover and its robotic arm for the 2024 University Rover Challenge.
    \item Creating a description package for the 6DOF robotic arm design to integrate with the ROS ecosystem.
    \item Leveraging micro-ROS to setup a node on STM32 Nucleo Board to communicate with a single-board computer.

    \item Worked on the hardware of a nano class (less than 250g) quadcopter drone.
    \item Sized the components of the quadcopter drive system for hover flight time and selected suitable off-the-shelf parts. 
    \item Designed and 3D-printed a sturdy quadcopter frame for prototyping using Fusion 360. 
          The frame was able to sustain multiple hard and crash landings during testing.
    \item Created circuit schematic and 2-layer PCB design for a USB-C charger board that integrates into
          the drone battery pack. This reduced the need for an external charger.
