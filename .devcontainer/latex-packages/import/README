This software is in the public domain; free of any restrictions.
All right are waived. No obligations are acknowleged.

Two new LaTeX commands, "\import {<full-path>} {<file>}" and 
"\subimport {<path-extension>} {<file>}" are defined to input 
a file from another directory, allowing that file to find its 
own inputs (using \input, \includegraphics etc.) in that directory.
Alias command names are "\inputfrom" and "\subinputfrom".

Also provided are \includefrom and \subincludefrom, which are
based on the \include command, rather than \input.
